1. Input and File Upload:
Allow users to upload email lists (typically in CSV, Excel, or plain text formats).
Validate the uploaded file type and size.
2. Email Syntax Validation:
Use regular expressions to check whether each email address has the correct syntax (e.g., user@example.com).
Reject emails with missing "@" symbols or incorrect domain structures.
3. Domain Validation:
Verify if the email's domain exists by querying DNS records (you can use libraries like dnspython).
If the domain doesn't exist, flag the email as invalid.
4. MX Record Lookup:
Perform an MX (Mail Exchange) record check for each domain to see if it has valid email servers.
If no valid MX record exists, mark the email as invalid.
5. Disposable Email Detection:
Check against a list of known disposable email providers (e.g., TempMail, Guerrilla Mail).
Flag disposable emails to prevent sending emails to temporary addresses.
6. Blacklist Check:
Check email addresses against known blacklists (e.g., Spamhaus) to see if the email has been reported as a source of spam or other malicious activity.
7. Syntax and Server Verification:
Use SMTP verification (through smtplib in Python) to check if the email's mailbox is active and accepting messages (you can use verify() methods or a service for faster results).
Ensure this is done in a way that doesnâ€™t trigger spam filters (some email servers may block or throttle connections if they detect bulk verification).
8. Generate Report:
Provide users with a downloadable report (CSV or Excel) showing which emails are valid, invalid, or flagged (disposable, blacklisted, etc.).
Include helpful stats like the percentage of valid emails and errors.
9. Optional Integration:
For advanced features, you could integrate with email marketing platforms (like Mailchimp or SendGrid) via their APIs, allowing users to directly upload cleaned lists or automatically sync their email lists.
10. User Interface:
Build a simple web-based UI with Flask or Django, where users can upload their email lists, track the progress, and download the results.
Display the list of emails with status markers (valid, invalid, etc.) in real-time if possible.
Technologies:
Backend: Python (Flask or Django)
Libraries/Tools:
validate_email or email-validator for email syntax validation
dnspython for domain and MX record lookup
SMTP libraries (smtplib) for email server verification
CSV/Excel processing libraries (pandas, openpyxl)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the UI)
Optional: External API services for bulk verification like Hunter.io, Kickbox, etc.
Next Steps:
Design the flow of the app (UI, features, etc.).
Start implementing the file upload and validation logic in Python.
Add domain and MX validation using DNS lookups.
Implement the report generation feature.
Test with a sample email list to ensure accuracy and performance.
